# [Challenge 03 - ReactJS Concepts](https://github.com/Rocketseat/bootcamp-gostack-desafios/tree/master/desafio-conceitos-reactjs)

In this challenge you have to create an application to train what you've learned so for with ReactJS!

Now you must keep developing the application that will store your repositories, in which you already developed the backend with NodeJS at the last challenge.

## Installing
1. Clone the application

```
git clone git@github.com:cleiver/GoStack11-Desafio03-conceitos-reactjs.git
```

2. Install dependencies

```
yarn
```

## Running the application

You have to be running the [backend application](https://github.com/cleiver/GoStack11-Desafio02-conceitos-nodejs) in order for this to work.

```
yarn start
```

## Running the tests

```
yarn test
```
